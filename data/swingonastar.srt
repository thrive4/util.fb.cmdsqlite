ðŸŽµ Would you like to swing on a star ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ Carry moonbeams home in a jar ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ And be better off than you are ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ Or would you rather be a mule ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ A mule is an animal with long funny ears ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ Kicks up at anything he hears ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ His back is brawny but his brain is weak ðŸŽµ

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,040
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak.

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
And by the way, if you hate to go to school,

4
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,180
you may grow up to be a mule.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,020
Or would you like to swing on a star,

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
carry moonbeams home in a jar,

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,700
and be better off than you are rude?

8
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,600
Or would you rather be a pig?

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,920
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,520
His shoes are a terrible disgrace.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,620
He has no manners when he eats his food.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,840
He's fat, lazy, and extremely rude.

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,580
But if you don't care a feather or a fig,

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,880
you may grow up to be a pig.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,780
Or would you like to swing on a star,

16
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,980
carry moonbeams home in a jar,

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,520
and be better off than you are rude?

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,620
Or would you rather be a fish?

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,900
A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,500
He can't write his name or read a book.

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,720
To fool the people is his only thought.

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,900
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught.

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,740
But then if that sort of life is what you wish,

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,120
you may grow up to be a fish.

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,200
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish,

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,520
and all the monkeys are in the zoo.

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,840
Every day you meet quite a few.

28
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,860
So you see, it's all up to you.

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,980
You can be better than you are.

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,620
You could be swinging on a star.

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,840
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,120
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
